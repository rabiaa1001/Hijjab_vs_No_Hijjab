# Hijjab_vs_No_Hijjab

Created my own dataset using unsplash images with augmentation to determine if a woman is wearing a hijjab or not. 
### Model Accuracy 99% 

## Summary
This application utilizes transfer learning techniques, and specifically a ResNet50 based classifier to classify whether or not a woman is wearing a hijjab "a covering or scarf over her head" (and it technically also means to cover modestly other female parts but we wont get into that). This is a binary classification ("Hijjab") or ("No Hijjab").
